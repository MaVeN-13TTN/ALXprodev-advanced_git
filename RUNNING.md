## 1. Setting up GitFlow

### Objective
Initialize a GitFlow workflow in a Git repository with proper branch structure and configuration.

### Why GitFlow?
GitFlow provides:
- **Structured branching model** for organized development
- **Clear separation of concerns** between development, staging, and production
- **Standardized workflow** that teams can follow consistently
- **Built-in support** for features, releases, and hotfixes
- **Reduced merge conflicts** through proper branch management

### Prerequisites
- Git installed and configured
- Repository created on GitHub
- Basic understanding of Git commands

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### 1.1 Install Git-Flow
```bash
# For Ubuntu/Debian systems
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git-flow

# Verify installation
git flow version
```

#### 1.2 Repository Setup
```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ALXprodev-advanced_git.git
cd ALXprodev-advanced_git

# Create develop branch
git checkout -b develop
git push -u origin develop

# Create main branch (if not exists)
git checkout -b main
git push -u origin main
```

#### 1.3 Initialize GitFlow
```bash
# Initialize with default settings
git flow init -d
```

**What this does:**
- Sets `main` as production branch
- Sets `develop` as integration branch  
- Configures prefixes for different branch types:
  - `feature/` for new features
  - `release/` for release preparation
  - `hotfix/` for emergency fixes
  - `bugfix/` for bug fixes
  - `support/` for support branches

#### 1.4 Verify Configuration
```bash
# Check GitFlow configuration
git flow config

# Check branch structure
git branch -a
```

### Key Learnings
- **Credential Management**: Always verify Git credentials before pushing
- **Branch Naming**: Follow consistent naming conventions
- **Remote Tracking**: Ensure branches are properly tracked on remote

---

## 2. Creating Feature Branches

### Objective
Learn to develop features in isolation using GitFlow feature branches.

### Why Feature Branches?
- **Isolation**: Keep feature development separate from main codebase
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple developers can work on different features
- **Code Review**: Features can be reviewed before integration
- **Rollback Capability**: Easy to discard incomplete features
- **Clean History**: Organized commit history with clear feature boundaries

### Implementation Process

#### 2.1 Create Feature Branch
```bash
# Start a new feature
git flow feature start implement-login

# This creates: feature/implement-login branch based on develop
```

**What happens internally:**
```bash
# Equivalent Git commands
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/implement-login
```

#### 2.2 Develop the Feature
```bash
# Create feature directory structure
mkdir login-page
cd login-page

# Create feature files
echo "Login Feature Coming soon" > README.md

# Add and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: scaffolding login page"
```

#### 2.3 Push Feature Branch
```bash
# Push to remote for collaboration
git push -u origin feature/implement-login
```

#### 2.4 Complete Feature Development
```bash
# Finish the feature (merges to develop)
git flow feature finish implement-login
```

**What happens internally:**
```bash
# Equivalent Git commands
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feature/implement-login
git branch -d feature/implement-login
git push origin develop
git push origin --delete feature/implement-login
```

### Multiple Feature Development
When working with multiple features:

```bash
# Feature 1: Login
git flow feature start implement-login
# ... develop login feature ...
git flow feature finish implement-login

# Feature 2: Signup  
git flow feature start implement-signup
# ... develop signup feature ...
git flow feature finish implement-signup
```

### Best Practices
- **Atomic Features**: Keep features small and focused
- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, descriptive branch names
- **Regular Commits**: Commit frequently with meaningful messages
- **Test Before Merge**: Ensure features work before finishing

---

## 3. Creating Release Branches

### Objective
Understand the release preparation process in GitFlow, including feature integration and production deployment.

### Why Release Branches?
- **Release Preparation**: Finalize features for production
- **Bug Fixes**: Fix issues discovered during release testing
- **Version Management**: Manage version numbers and release notes
- **Stabilization**: Stabilize code before production deployment
- **Parallel Development**: Continue feature development while preparing releases

### Implementation Process

#### 3.1 Prepare Features for Release
Before creating a release, ensure all desired features are merged into `develop`:

```bash
# Verify all features are in develop
git checkout develop
git log --oneline --graph

# Example output should show merged features:
# *   e247a28 Merge branch 'feature/implement-login' into develop
# * | 087751d feat: scaffolding signup page
# |/  
# * 3f84635 Add Git vs Git-Flow documentation
```

#### 3.2 Create Release Branch
```bash
# Start release preparation
git flow release start 1.0.0
```

**What happens internally:**
```bash
# Equivalent Git commands
git checkout develop
git checkout -b release/1.0.0
```

#### 3.3 Release Preparation Tasks
```bash
# Make release-specific changes
# Example: Update documentation, configuration, version numbers

# Update signup feature requirements
echo "feature coming soon

data requirements: email, firstName, lastName, profilePic" > signup-page/README.md

# Commit release changes
git add .
git commit -m "docs: add data requirements for signup feature"

# Push release branch for team collaboration
git push -u origin release/1.0.0
```

#### 3.4 Complete Release
```bash
# Finish the release
git flow release finish 1.0.0
```

**What happens internally:**
```bash
# Complex series of operations:
# 1. Merge release branch to main
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff release/1.0.0

# 2. Create version tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"

# 3. Merge release changes back to develop
git checkout develop  
git merge --no-ff release/1.0.0

# 4. Clean up release branch
git branch -d release/1.0.0
git push origin --delete release/1.0.0

# 5. Push all changes
git push origin main
git push origin develop
git push origin --tags
```

### Version Tagging Strategy
```bash
# Semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
v1.0.0  # Initial release
v1.0.1  # Patch release (bug fixes)
v1.1.0  # Minor release (new features)
v2.0.0  # Major release (breaking changes)
```

### Release Verification
```bash
# Verify release completion
git log --oneline --all --graph
git tag -l
git branch -a
```

## 4. Git Hooks and Automation

### Objective
Implement Git hooks to automate workflow validation and logging.

### Why Git Hooks?
- **Quality Control**: Enforce standards before commits
- **Automation**: Reduce manual tasks and human error
- **Consistency**: Ensure all team members follow same practices
- **Audit Trail**: Log important events for tracking
- **Integration**: Connect with CI/CD and other tools

### Hook Types Implemented

#### 4.1 Pre-commit Hook
**Purpose**: Validate repository structure before allowing commits.

**Location**: `.git/hooks/pre-commit`

**Implementation**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Pre-commit hook to check if each directory has a README file
echo "Running pre-commit hook: Checking for README files in directories..."

# Get the root directory of the repository
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)

# Initialize flag to track if all directories have README files
ALL_DIRS_HAVE_README=true
MISSING_README_DIRS=()

# Find all directories in the repository (excluding .git and hidden directories)
while IFS= read -r -d '' dir; do
    # Skip .git directory and other hidden directories
    if [[ "$dir" == *"/.git"* ]] || [[ "$(basename "$dir")" == .* ]]; then
        continue
    fi
    
    # Check if directory has any README file (case insensitive)
    if ! ls "$dir"/README* >/dev/null 2>&1 && ! ls "$dir"/readme* >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        ALL_DIRS_HAVE_README=false
        MISSING_README_DIRS+=("$dir")
    fi
done < <(find "$REPO_ROOT" -type d -print0)

# If any directory is missing a README file, reject the commit
if [ "$ALL_DIRS_HAVE_README" = false ]; then
    echo "❌ Pre-commit hook failed!"
    echo "The following directories are missing README files:"
    printf '%s\n' "${MISSING_README_DIRS[@]}"
    echo ""
    echo "Please add a README file to each directory before committing."
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Pre-commit hook passed: All directories have README files!"
exit 0
```

**Setup**:
```bash
# Create the hook file
nano .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Make it executable
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

**Testing**:
```bash
# Test failure case
mkdir test-dir
echo "test content" > test-dir/test.txt
git add test-dir/
git commit -m "test commit"
# Output: ❌ Pre-commit hook failed!

# Test success case  
echo "# Test Directory" > test-dir/README.md
git add test-dir/README.md
git commit -m "test commit"
# Output: ✅ Pre-commit hook passed!
```

#### 4.2 Post-merge Hook
**Purpose**: Log merges into the main branch for audit and tracking.

**Location**: `.git/hooks/post-merge`

**Implementation**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Post-merge hook to log merges into the main branch
echo "Running post-merge hook: Logging merge activity..."

# Get current branch name
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# Get the merge commit information
MERGE_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
MERGE_AUTHOR=$(git log -1 --pretty=format:'%an <%ae>')
MERGE_DATE=$(git log -1 --pretty=format:'%ci')
MERGE_MESSAGE=$(git log -1 --pretty=format:'%s')

# Check if we're on the main branch
if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "main" ]; then
    echo "🎯 Merge detected into main branch!"
    
    # Create logs directory if it doesn't exist
    LOGS_DIR=".git/logs/custom"
    mkdir -p "$LOGS_DIR"
    
    # Log file path
    LOG_FILE="$LOGS_DIR/merge-log.txt"
    
    # Create log entry
    echo "========================================" >> "$LOG_FILE"
    echo "MERGE INTO MAIN BRANCH DETECTED" >> "$LOG_FILE"
    echo "Date: $MERGE_DATE" >> "$LOG_FILE"
    echo "Author: $MERGE_AUTHOR" >> "$LOG_FILE" 
    echo "Commit Hash: $MERGE_COMMIT" >> "$LOG_FILE"
    echo "Commit Message: $MERGE_MESSAGE" >> "$LOG_FILE"
    echo "Branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH" >> "$LOG_FILE"
    echo "Repository: $(basename $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel))" >> "$LOG_FILE"
    echo "========================================" >> "$LOG_FILE"
    echo "" >> "$LOG_FILE"
    
    echo "📝 Merge logged to: $LOG_FILE"
    echo "✅ Post-merge hook completed successfully!"
else
    echo "ℹ️  Merge detected on branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH (not main, skipping detailed logging)"
fi

exit 0
```

**Setup**:
```bash
# Create the hook file
nano .git/hooks/post-merge

# Make it executable  
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-merge
```

**Testing**:
```bash
# Create a test merge to main
git checkout develop
git checkout -b test-branch
echo "test" > test-file.txt
git add test-file.txt
git commit -m "test commit"
git checkout main
git merge test-branch

# Check the log
cat .git/logs/custom/merge-log.txt
```

### Hook Management Best Practices

#### 4.3 Hook Development Guidelines
- **Fast Execution**: Keep hooks lightweight and fast
- **Clear Feedback**: Provide informative messages to users
- **Error Handling**: Handle edge cases gracefully
- **Documentation**: Comment your hook scripts thoroughly
- **Testing**: Test hooks in various scenarios

#### 4.4 Hook Sharing Strategies
Since `.git/hooks` is not tracked by Git:

**Option 1: Scripts Directory**
```bash
# Create tracked hooks directory
mkdir scripts/hooks
cp .git/hooks/pre-commit scripts/hooks/
cp .git/hooks/post-merge scripts/hooks/

# Add installation script
echo '#!/bin/bash
cp scripts/hooks/* .git/hooks/
chmod +x .git/hooks/*' > scripts/install-hooks.sh
chmod +x scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

**Option 2: Hook Management Tools**
- **Husky** (Node.js projects)
- **pre-commit** (Python-based)
- **overcommit** (Ruby-based)

## 5. Best Practices and Lessons Learned

### 5.1 GitFlow Best Practices

#### Branch Management
- **Keep main clean**: Only production-ready code
- **Use develop for integration**: All features merge here first
- **Short-lived feature branches**: Complete features quickly
- **Descriptive branch names**: `feature/user-authentication`, not `feature/fix`

#### Commit Practices
- **Conventional commits**: Use prefixes like `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`
- **Atomic commits**: One logical change per commit
- **Clear messages**: Explain what and why, not just what

#### Release Management
- **Version tagging**: Use semantic versioning consistently
- **Release notes**: Document changes for each release
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test releases before finishing
- **Hotfix strategy**: Have a plan for emergency fixes

### 5.2 Common Pitfalls and Solutions

#### Problem: Merge Conflicts
**Solution**: 
- Regularly sync feature branches with develop
- Keep feature branches small and focused
- Communicate with team about overlapping work

#### Problem: Lost Work
**Solution**:
- Push feature branches regularly
- Use `git reflog` to recover lost commits
- Create backup branches for complex features

#### Problem: Inconsistent Workflow
**Solution**:
- Document team workflow clearly
- Use Git hooks to enforce standards
- Regular team training on GitFlow

### 5.3 Team Collaboration Guidelines
- **Code reviews**: Use pull requests for all merges
- **Branch protection**: Protect main and develop branches
- **CI/CD integration**: Automate testing and deployment
- **Communication**: Keep team informed about releases and hotfixes

## 6. Troubleshooting

### 6.1 Common GitFlow Issues

#### Issue: GitFlow not initialized
```bash
# Error: gitflow is not initialized
# Solution:
git flow init -d
```

#### Issue: Branch diverged
```bash
# Error: Branches have diverged
# Solution:
git pull origin develop
git flow feature start feature-name
```

#### Issue: Hook not executing
```bash
# Check hook permissions
ls -la .git/hooks/pre-commit
# Should show: -rwxrwxr-x

# Fix permissions
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### 6.2 Recovery Procedures

#### Recover from failed release
```bash
# If git flow release finish fails
git checkout main
git merge release/1.0.0
git tag v1.0.0
git checkout develop
git merge release/1.0.0
git branch -d release/1.0.0
```

#### Reset to known good state
```bash
# Reset branch to remote state
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/develop
```

### 6.3 Advanced Troubleshooting
- **Use `git reflog`** to find lost commits
- **Check remote tracking** with `git branch -vv`
- **Verify GitFlow config** with `git flow config`
- **Check hook execution** with `bash -x .git/hooks/pre-commit`
